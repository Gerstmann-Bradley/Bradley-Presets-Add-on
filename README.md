Upon enabling the addon, it will automatically add an asset library path and download a preset blend file from a public GitHub repository containing geometry node assets. Assets will be updated automatically each time Blender starts. Some examples of assets include various kinds of "falloff", "simulations" for motion graphic purposes and others. The aim is to speed up the workflow for complex geometry nodes work.
